## 🚀 How to Run

### 📦 Requirements

Just Python 3.6+  
No external dependencies, no bloatware, no shady install scripts.

### 🛠️ Steps

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python funny_password_generator.py
````

> Or if you're on a system with Python 3 aliased differently:

```bash
python3 funny_password_generator.py
```

---

## ⚙️ Customization

The script asks you:

* How long should the password be?
* Should it contain:

  * Uppercase letters? (YES, PLEASE)
  * Lowercase letters?
  * Digits (0-9)?
  * Special symbols like `@#$%`?

Say yes or no and the generator delivers the magic.

## 🤔 Why So Funny?

Because security doesn't have to be boring.
This script roasts bad password choices and celebrates good ones — like a stand-up comic who read the OWASP Top 10.

## 💡 Inspiration

Built with:

* Python's `secrets` module 🔐
* Sass, sarcasm, and dark humor ☕
* The burning desire to never use `Password123` again
